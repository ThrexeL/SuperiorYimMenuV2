# YimMenu Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, ethnicity, programming experience, race, gender and sexual identity, etc. As a rule of thumb, any comment that isn't relevant to the menu or the contributions at hand is prohibited

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Treating everyone with respect and cordiality
* Welcoming new contributors
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints
* Focusing on what is best for the project

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Trolling
* Talking about politics (or using political imagery, including images of Pepe and Wojaks)
* Racial slurs
* Using avatars that show apparent affiliations to extremist organizations
* Harassment
* Doxxing
* Opening pull requests containing leaked or otherwise copyrighted code
* Promoting unrelated personal projects
* Attempting to recruit contributors
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently *any* contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including this repository and on the [Matrix server](https://matrix.to/#/#yimmenu:matrix.org). The code of conduct, however, does not apply to the actual menu codebase

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior should be reported in the Matrix room. All comments, issues, etc. violating this code of conduct will be swiftly removed, and the person blocked if they have no intention to contribute collegially to the project

## Why Have a Code of Conduct?

Unfortunately, as you may already be aware, the game hacking and the wider gaming community is [filled](https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-has-banned-over-350-000-players-for-racism-1846975082) [with](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/images/smilies/black.png) [bigots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_%28harassment_campaign%29), and otherwise [unsavory people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//pol/) who tend to drive away contributors and slow down development by engaging in pointless drivel. To this end, having a code of conduct ensures these people are quickly removed before they could cause significant disruption to the project. This is purely basic decency and has nothing to with being "woke" or "liberal" or whatever certain people may interpret it to be. If you feel that not being able to say racial slurs, for example, is a significant violation of your rights, then please feel free to contribute elsewhere; you're in good company, after all
